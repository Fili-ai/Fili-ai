# About Me

Hi, I'm Filippo a MSc student of Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico of Milan. 
My passion passed from Machine Learning and Statistical Learning to High-Performance Computing (HPC) without forgetting cybersecurity. 
This space is my digital playground where curiosity meets code, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. 

I'm a student with a fervor for unraveling the intricacies of data and building intelligent systems. My curiosity knows no bounds, and I believe in the transformative power of technology to reshape our world. Whether it's diving into the depths of machine learning algorithms, deciphering statistical patterns, or harnessing the potential of high-performance computing, I'm always up for a challenge.
